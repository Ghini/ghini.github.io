Luca Ghini (Casalfiumanese 1490 – Bologna, May 4, 1556) was an Italian
physician and botanist, notable as the creator of the first recorded
herbarium, as well as the first botanical garden in
Europe. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Ghini)

Pisa, home town to Luca Ghini's first botanical garden, is where the current
maintainer of this software, Mario Frasca, completed his computer science
studies.

After adopting this software as Bauble, and having long been struggling in
Spanish speaking Latin America getting the name correctly pronounced, and
even worse having to correct every time the automatic translation made it
become a "bagatella", "babiole", or even "chuchería", the Italian speaking
maintainer thought it was high time to choose something else, meaningless to
translating software, and more clearly related to botany.
