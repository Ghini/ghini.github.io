Luca Ghini (Casalfiumanese 1490 – Bologna, May 4, 1556) was an Italian
physician and botanist, notable as the creator of the first recorded
herbarium, as well as the first botanical garden in
Europe. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Ghini)

Mario Frasca, the current maintainer of this software, completed his
computer science studies in Pisa, home town to Luca Ghini's first botanical
garden.

After adopting this software as Bauble, struggling in Spanish speaking Latin
America with getting the name correctly pronounced, and even worse having to
correct every time the automatic translation made it become a "bagatella" or
"chuchería", the Italian speaking maintainer just thought it would be better
to have a name that means nothing at all, but which was more clearly related
to botany.
