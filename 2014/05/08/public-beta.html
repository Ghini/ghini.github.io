<p>There has been quite a bit of interest in Bauble over the past few months.
Thanks for everyone&#39;s comments and feedback.  Several people have asked about
when Bauble will be ready and I wish we had a better answer.  The project has
been shaping up nicely but it has been taking longer than we would like.
Sometimes that just the way it goes.</p>

<p>In order to satisfy your itch we&#39;ve decied to open Bauble up as a
public beta.  What does that mean?  It means that you can start using Bauble
today at <a href="http://app.bauble.io">http://app.bauble.io</a>.</p>

<p>Be warned this is a <strong>beta</strong> release and should not be used for your invaluable
plants collections.  Some things will most likely be broken.  Your computer may
catch on fire.  Babies may cry.  But please, by all means, try it out and let
us know what you think.  This is your chance to evaluate Bauble and see if it
would be right for you and your plant collections.</p>

<p>So what does work right now?</p>

<ul>
<li>Basic collection management including creating taxa, accessions, plants and locations.</li>
<li>Powerful data searching.</li>
<li>Default database populated with APG3 families and genera.</li>
<li>Daily automated backups. Your data is safe.</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the next month or so we&#39;re going to hash out the details try to squeeze in
a couple more features including:</p>

<ul>
<li>A report generator.</li>
<li>Managing propagation records.</li>
<li>Documentation.</li>
</ul>

<p>As always please <a href="http://bauble.io/contact/">tell us what you think</a>.</p>
