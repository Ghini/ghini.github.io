<p>Thanks for tuning in to our first blog post.  For those of you that
don&#39;t know Bauble is a web app for managing plant collections.  It is
primarily for botanic gardens and arboreta to manage their living collections
using modern curatorial practices.</p>

<p>Bauble was started as an open source project in 2004 at
<a href="http://belizebotanic.org">Belize Botanic Gardens</a> and was freely available to
anyone who wanted to use it.  The original version of Bauble, or Bauble
Classic, was a desktop application that you installed on your computer.</p>

<p>The fruit hasn&#39;t fallen far from the tree. Bauble is still an
<a href="http://opensource.org/">open source</a> project but it has moved on from it&#39;s
humble beginnings and is now an advanced, modern web app that allows you to
host your plant records in the cloud.</p>

<p>Here at Bauble.io we are offering a hosted version of Bauble for your
convenience.  That means you don&#39;t need to worry about the continous
maintenance, backups, servers, IT staff, support and a whole list of headaches
that comes with managing your plant records.  By using Bauble you can spend
time managing your collection and landscapes and not your IT infrastructure.</p>

<p>Bauble.io isn&#39;t quite ready for prime time but we&#39;re shooting for our first
release in the beginning of Summer 2014.
