* Ghini is designed to be simple and fast, elegant and intuitive.

* Ghini is open and free. Ghini is licensed under the GNU Public License, which approximately means that anybody can download, study, distribute, change the source code for Ghini as long as all derived work stays just as free as Ghini is now. This does not in any way affect how you decide to copyright and license the data you manage with Ghini.

* Ghini is cross-platform. Ghini supports both Linux and Windows and has been successfully ported to other platforms whenever there was interest.

* Ghini can use different database backends and is tested against SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB.

* Ghini can generate reports through the extremely flexible Mako formatter. This allows you to layout your data any way you wish and save it in a just about any format you can imagine including PostScript, XML, or HTML. We acknowledge that writing a mako script is not something we can expect from a botanist, so we are organizing an on-line repository for common reports.

* Ghini can export data in CSV or Access to Biological Collection Data (ABCD) format. Ghini adheres to the ITF2 standard for field naming and content, but it does not yet contain an import-export feature for this format. Other import-export formats can be discussed and added to Ghini if the need arises.

* Ghini supports tagging. You can tag any arbitrary data stored in a Ghini managed database with arbitrary names. This way you can create collections of records organized the way you want with names you give them.

* ....and lots more. (And I mean lots!)
