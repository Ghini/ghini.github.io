* **Ghini is open and free**. Ghini is licensed under the GNU Public License, which approximately means that anybody can download, study, distribute, change the source code for Ghini as long as all derived work stays just as free as Ghini is now. This does not in any way affect how you decide to copyright and license the data you manage with Ghini.

* **supported platforms**: 
  * ghini.desktop is **cross-platform**, running equally well on GNU/Linux, Windows, and MacOSX.
  * ghini.web prefers GNU/Linux but should run on any platform supporting nodejs.
  * Ghini's mobile apps only run on **Android** (Apple makes its platform far too expensive for our limited resources).

* required **database servers**: 
  * ghini.desktop can use different database backends and is tested against SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB.
  * ghini.web uses mongo.
  * Ghini's mobile apps use Android's sqlite3 databases.

* **interface languages**: Ghini's software and documentation, written in English, is continously actively translated, by native speakers, into several languages.  The most complete ones are Ukrainian, Spanish, Hungarian, Italian, Portuguese...

* ghini.desktop can **generate reports** through the extremely flexible Mako formatter. This allows you to layout your data any way you wish and save it in a just about any format you can imagine including PostScript, XML, or HTML. We acknowledge that writing a mako script is not something we can expect from a botanist: somewhere on our to-do list we have "organizing an on-line repository for common reports".

* ghini.desktop can **export data** in CSV or Access to Biological Collection Data (ABCD) format. Ghini adheres to the ITF2 standard for field naming and content, but it does not yet contain an import-export feature for this format. Other import-export formats can be discussed and added to Ghini if the need arises.

* ghini.desktop supports **tagging**. You can tag any arbitrary data with arbitrary names. This way you can create collections of records organized the way you want with names you give them.

* ....and lots more. (And I mean lots!)
