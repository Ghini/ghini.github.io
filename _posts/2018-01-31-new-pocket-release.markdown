Just published a quite different ghini.pocket version.  Technically, it is
not any more based on 'Activity', but on 'Fragment'.  From the user point of
view, this means that using the 'back' button will bring you to whatever
other program you were using before activating ghini.pocket.

Swipe left, or right, to move to a different fragment.

We now have four pages:
