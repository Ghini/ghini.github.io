Just published APK#2, a quite different ghini.pocket version.

Technically, it is not any more based on 'Activity', but on 'Fragment'.

From the user point of view, this means that you Swipe left, or right, to
move to a different fragment.  Using the 'back' button will bring you to
whatever other program you were using before activating ghini.pocket.

We have the same two pages as before:

- search
- results

and we still use ODK Collect to collect corrections, but I'm thinking of
incorporating that activity into a new third ghini.pocket fragment.
