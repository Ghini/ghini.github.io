just an experiment, no more than [28kbytes of
code](https://github.com/mfrasca/taxonomic-help/), and we have the same
taxonomic help offered by ghini.pocket, in an N9, nokia's MeeGo phone.

it is ways faster writing than with Android, and I have been testing this,
not only because I wanted to have that same taxonomic help at hand in my
phone, but also because, who knows, maybe it's possible to compile this code
and run it as-is on Android.  this would speed up development on my side.
