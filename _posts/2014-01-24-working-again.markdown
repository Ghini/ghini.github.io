We can again use Bauble, so we're happy.

I did have a look at bauble.web, I didn't follow its structure, but it's
clear that it does not do mapping, which is my focus at the moment.  So I
guess we will be inserting data via old bauble, and view it via new ghini.

Maybe I will clean up some docs in old bauble, but I will definitely focus
on my own ghini web project: publishing a bauble database on a web site, all
JavaScript, client and server side.  I don't know beans about nodejs, it
will be an interesting task.
