I just entered Ecuador, in the hope to find interested gardens here.
Colombia's organization seems too tight, top-down, for gardens to be able to
take an independent decision.

Anyhow, I think we need some better documentation, and I want to have it in
Spanish, too.

The software itself is automatically translated in the configured system
language, if the configured language is among the several translated ones.
It is possible to have translated documentation as well, but then the
technicalities are different.  First of all: the documentation gets
"compiled" at each commit at the remote 'readthedocs' site.

We already have the project on weblate, we ask Michal Čihař for support and
ideas, we register documentation components next to the software one, and
let's wait for people to volunteer translations.
