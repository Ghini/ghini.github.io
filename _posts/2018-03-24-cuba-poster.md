In preparation to [the next Cuba regional
conference](http://botanicalbridges.planta.ngo), finances don't allow us to
participate, so we have prepared a poster.  I'm not particularly proud of
it: making posters is not among my best skills, but it will probably be
better, having a so-and-so poster, than no poster at all.
