New year, new name, so much has been changing in the desktop software, that
it has become quite different than the original 'bauble'.  The web prototype
has been growing slow, it's still not much more than a prototype, but let's
just choose this day and finally say it's time to join stuff under one name.

The external event triggering the decision was the original author rolling
back changes by other authors and publishing his personal 'bauble' version.
I would not like to have two different programs under the same name: better
two different programs under two different names.

Thanks to Francesca Ponzio for the new logo!
