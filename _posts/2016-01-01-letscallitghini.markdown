New year, new name, so much has been changing in the software, that it has
become quite different than the original 'bauble'.

The change was in the air, and the event triggering it was the original
author rolling back changes and publishing his personal 'bauble' version.  I
would not like to have two different programs under the same name: better
two different programs under two different names.

Thanks to Francesca Ponzio for the new logo!
