Wikipedia had a generic page related to accession numbers, not specific to
botany, but presenting the concept in several collection fields.  I had done
some work gathering information, and I thought it would be fair to spread
the knowledge.  Moreover, publishing on the Wikipedia exposes one to peer
review, which is always a good opportunity for learning further.
