Good morning everyone,

this is an invitation to the whole [Irish Botanic
Community](http://facebook.com/groups/1096248437134000/)

Become [Ghini](http://ghini.github.io/) users!

Ghini is an integral collection of open and free software programs, focusing
on [desktop database management](http://ghini.readthedocs.io/), with a
handheld [tool for data
collection](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.ghini.pocket),
a central web server aggregating collections and [presenting them on the
web](http://gardens.ghini.me/), a [visitor's
tool](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.ghini.tour) for
guided visits.

An extra, for those with a Rhododendron collection: you can build upon [this
database](http://www.ghini.me/rhododendra.db), already initialised with 641
accepted species in the Rhododendron genus.  Corrections, integrations,
synonymies very welcome!

best regards.
