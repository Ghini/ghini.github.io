a web based interface to botanical garden databases

rationale

ghini, the name is inspired to Luca Ghini, has the aim to offer a web-based
interface to a database complying to the ITF2 reccomendations.

the idea was born when Mario Frasca (mathematician) and
Saskia Bantjes (agronomist, environmentalist) get in contact with the
cuchubo garden in Mompox.  the wish to describe it, the thankful words by the
president of the foundation named after the cuchubo garden, pushes the two
to seek formal help at the botanical garden of the utrecht university, where
they get support by the conservator Eric Gouda.

future is unwritten, but check the issues page.
