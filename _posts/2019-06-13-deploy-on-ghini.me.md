This is a technical entry, something like the "for me from myself" presents
we used to include among the Christmas presents. The intention is to share
the pleasure to receive a welcome present with the rest of you.

if the technicalities scare you, the message here is simply: ghini reloaded
is going on-line at http://cuaderno.ghini.me, and the reason behind the name
is that the collection shown is a 'cuaderno de colecta'.

let's start.

First of all, we need a recent Python version, that's at least 3.5.  We
first considered installing from source, that would give us 3.7.4, but we
got entangled in such a cascade of dependencies, that after some three hours
not seeing the end of it, we just decided we would make the step from debian
8 (oldstable) to debian 9 (stable).  There's something funny about this, and
that's we are about to end again in 'oldstable', because Debian 10 is
expected soon.

pip and virtualenv are both included, but if we keep calling them this way,
we end up with python2.  so no pip, it's now pip3, and no virtualenv, it's
now the much less memorizable `python3 -m venv`.  so much for
'deprecated'.  uff.

So what do we do â€¦ 

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
python3 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/ghini/
mkdir -p ~/Local/github/mfrasca
cd ~/Local/github/mfrasca
( git clone git@github.com:mfrasca/ghini.git ||
  git clone https://github.com/mfrasca/ghini.git )
cd ghini
. ~/.virtualenvs/ghini/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

This goes without hassle, it's just standard ways to any python3 program.
Make sure you can create virtual environments, download the software, create
a virtual environment for the software, activate it, and install the
software in its isolated new virtual environment.

Since all went fine, let's also initialize a database and bootstrap it with
some 20k taxa, mostly with synonymy and authorship.

```bash
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py import_genera_derivation
```

now the more difficult parts come.

We have to register a name for the outside site.  So let's tell our domain
registrar that `cuaderno` is among the names we want to offer.

Next, we have to couple all http requests relative to `cuaderno` to an
internal port.  That's something for nginx.  Create an 'available' site, and
enable it, using some templates, or copying around stuff, and adapting.

When done, we need to reload the nginx configuration.  What other command
makes sense, other than this:

```bash
sudo service nginx reload
```

what else, quite a bit really:

- enable cuaderno to reach django,
- we need https,
- we need to deploy the program properly, not just run the develompent server,
- we need some data.

This isn't going to happen today.  I'll leave the program up and running,
there's a guest/guest user, with full access to the data, so you may have a
look, and experiment.
