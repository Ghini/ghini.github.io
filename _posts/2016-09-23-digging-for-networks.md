I have been digging for information, this was during the Panama regional
conference.  In the meanwhile, since I'm writing this post 18 months later
than the timestamp, I can't recall where I found the information, but here
it comes, so maybe it can be used as reference.

- SEABG: South East Asia Botanic Gardens.
- EABGN: East Asia Botanic.
- European garden network / consortium

Conservation action plan for botanic gardens of the Caribbean islands 
publication mentioned on amazon and BGCI - publisher, Peter as co-author.
the links on BGCI page are broken

not mentioned in list of BGCI publications

it's been in a drawer for 18 years, target group not even aware of existence.

At the conference we had two of the three copyright holders of the
publication.  It would be so nice if we could find the third person, and
have all agree in changing the license to an Creative Commons, and make it
available.

2018-03-23: I'm afraid I need to dig for it again, and ask a direct question
to the copyright holders.
