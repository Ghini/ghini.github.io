Last few weeks working at two separate issues, a larger one where I've been
updating the software to Python3 and Gtk3, then reviewing user contributions
regarding the Windows installer for ghini-1.0.

I'm quite happy to tell you that we now not only have a Windows installer,
we can also run ghini.desktop from a USB stick.  Just plug it into a trusted
Windows machine, and start it without needing any installation.  Your data
stays next to the software, on the USB stick, and ghini will always find it.

This is going to be included in ghini-1.0.86, which I plan to publish in a
couple of days: we have a new Dutch translator, and he's kindly reviewing
all my mistakes and incongruencies.

Check our [releases on github](https://github.com/Ghini/ghini.desktop/releases).
