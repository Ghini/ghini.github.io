We are making a very first attempt at compiling and personalizing audio
wand.  Audio-wand is an app, developed at the Edinburgh Royal Botanical
Garden, and has been published on github.  it's not yet too clear what is
the license, I did ask permission and I'm waiting for an answer, but what is
clearly implicit in publishing it on github is that it is open source, so we
can have a look.

Please do expect more than you can see now!

We might not choose for audiowand in the end (I have some technical doubts,
about running in a browser, and about the need to draw your own maps), but
we are going to ship a ghini audio guide soon, anyway.
