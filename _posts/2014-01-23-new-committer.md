I'm slowly recovering from my first hemorragic dengue, let's hope I won't
need to go through a second one.  During the first week of January Saskia
and I moved to Mompox, she's going to describe the "Cuchubo" botanic garden,
I'm going to support her with the database.

A couple of years ago we came across this 'bauble' thing, and we came back
to it now.  it's not working any more: library have changed, things have
been deprecated, and are now unsupported, the whole software needs some
care.  The new bauble.web is still just a project, and Brett suggests we
just use the classic version: as far as he's concerned, future lays in
bauble.web, and he's not going to work at bauble.classic any longer.

in Mompox we only need something working, we don't care if it's web or
desktop, as long as it worksâ€”right now, so I forked the software, and will
have a look, it can't be that difficult, just updating a few dependencies,
can it?
