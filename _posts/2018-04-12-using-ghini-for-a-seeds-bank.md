We often come in contact with groups doing seeds, not plants, and we finally
made time to explain how to use ghini.desktop in their case.  [Find it in
the
docs](http://ghini.readthedocs.io/en/ghini-1.0-dev/use_cases.html#using-ghini-for-a-seed-database)

All terms still apply, you just have to read some of them slightly differently.

Enjoy, and feedback.
