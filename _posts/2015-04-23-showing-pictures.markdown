issue #51 was about associating pictures to plants.  this was my first
serious addition to bauble, and it was an addition that the Botanical Garden
in Quito was willing to finance.  it cost me some three days work.

- work in progress on #51. can select and store picture root folder, augmenting configuration file.

- the button now shows either a picture or a explainatory text.  the button
  does not yet do much, but in both cases (picture or text, it should let
  the user choose a file).

- related to #51. it's now able to record pictures.
  it does not show the picture at the moment it's associated to the plant.
  nor does it replace an old picture in case you select a new one.

- closes #51: picture is stored, updated, shown.
