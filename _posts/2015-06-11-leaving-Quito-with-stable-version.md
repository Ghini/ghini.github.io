We are about to close two months collaboration with the Garden in Quito.
Thanks a lot to Felipe Andrade, I've enjoyed working with you.

We developed a way for Felipe to update the software with minimum effort,
working on any system where we installed Bauble: just run a script, you will
receive the changes from your installed version to the most recent one, the
script will refresh the installation and there you are.

In case an update should break your installation, you can just as easy go
back to the previous situation, no need to do any extra download.

You do need to open the terminal and give one or two commands, typing them
by hand and making sure you understand the difference between a <SPACE>, a
<UNDERLINE>, a <MINUS>, or at least making sure you copy what you see.

Just call Huston if you need help.  or Skype me, that's possibly easier.
