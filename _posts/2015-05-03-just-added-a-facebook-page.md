so, we just added a Facebook page.  we're going to publicise our activities
there, too, and we start by informing the public about what Bauble is, and
where to find information about us.

our [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bauble), the
[internationalisation efforts on
weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/bauble/), [our code on
github](https://github.com/Bauble/), and now also [a facebook
page](https://www.facebook.com/bauble.thesoftware/).

update:

7 months later, I joined bauble.classic under Ghini, and renamed it to
ghini.desktop.
