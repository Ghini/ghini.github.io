expanding and simplifying the family, and describing the interconnection among components.

- square blocks are programs involved with ghini,

  their background colour indicates whether the program is part of the
  Ghini family (pale blue) or just adopted or otherwise supporting Ghini (okra).

- arrows indicate data flows,

  dark green: continuous data flows, the core purpouse of the program involved.

  pale green: occasional data flows, configurations, imports or exports.

- red lines are control lines and are specific to occasional data flows.

  a red line starting at a program block and ending with a bullet on a
  data flow indicates which program initiates that particular data flow.
