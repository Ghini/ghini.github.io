expanding and simplifying the family, and describing the interconnection among components.

- square blocks represent programs and their icons suggest their role

  their background colour indicates whether the program is part of the
  Ghini family (pale blue) or just adopted or otherwise supporting Ghini (okra).

- thick green arrows indicate data flows,

  dark green: continuous data flows, the core purpouse of the program involved.

  pale green: occasional data flows, configurations, imports or exports.

- red lines are control lines and are specific to occasional data flows.

  a red line starting at a program block and ending with a bullet on a
  data flow indicates which program initiates that particular data flow.

please note: this page is just today's article, while the [final reference
document](http://ghini.readthedocs.io/en/ghini-1.0-dev/ghini-family.html) is
in our documentation, and that is what we keep up to date, and what our
translators help us distribute in several languages.
