Ghini has finally made the move to Python3.  It was a long due step, Python2 is
reaching end of life, and support will be dropped after January 1st, 2020.  Although
the new ghini.desktop-3.1 is functionally 99% the same as ghini.desktop-1.0, they are
however not compatible on database level.  Here you have a brief overview of the most
visible differences:

we fixed two design mistakes: one which made taxon tables mutually inconsistent and
the code less readable, one which prevented us from using ghini on a PostGIS
database.

ghini.desktop-3.1 allows for Notes to Locations and to Tags.

In particular adding notes to Tags, and the new more compact interface makes Tags
more akin to NoSQL documents.  As in g.d-1.0, you can attach them to as many objects
as you like, now in g.d-3.1 you can define their structure on the fly.
