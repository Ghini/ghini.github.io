bauble.classic-1.0.15 is the first version published by Mario Frasca (from
the Ghini organization) straight into Bauble.  Up to this moment, I had been
working in my own sandbox 'mfrasca' and I would file merge requests.

To save time, Brett just gave me writing rights in the repository, and I
don't see any need to keep my own fork, just share what I'm doing straight
into the Bauble organization repository.
