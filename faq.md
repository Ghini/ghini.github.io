* Why was the original Bauble project started?

  At [Belize Botanic Gardens](http://www.belizebotanic.org/) people felt that the other collection management software was either too expensive, inadequate or only supported Windows so they decided to create their own.

* But why for free?

  Wait: when we state that Ghini and Bauble are free software, we speak
  about freedom, not about price.  Bauble and the whole Ghini family are
  copyrighted and distributed under the GNU Public License.  You are free to
  use, study, alter, and to pass it to a colleague or a friend, but you will
  grant others the same rights granted to you.

  Said this, the authors acknowledge that commercial collection management
  software is economically out of reach for most institutions, save the
  largest ones in a few countries.  Bauble/Ghini contribute to providing
  unrestricted access to management of information related to biodiversity.

* So again, is there a price attached to Ghini/Bauble?

  If you are able to download, install, configure, and learn using (and the
  documentation explains all of it), then Ghini is being offered free of
  charge, for the simple reason that you're not costing time nor effort to
  the Ghini people.

  If you need help to do any of the above, we are professionally available,
  and the cost we generally compute related to what you can pay, and to
  wages in your own country.

* What's this GNU Public License?

  Ghini and Bauble are not just free as free beer, they are free as free
  speech.  The GPL license introduced the concept of
  [Copylefted](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.html) and guarantees
  that the freedoms you are given with the product will stick to the product
  _for ever_.  The GPL answers the question "what if someone makes it
  proprietary": only the owners of the copyright can do that, and Ghini has
  already no less than 10 authors.

* How can I contribute to development?

  This is a question we love hearing!  You can hire a Bauble/Ghini developer
  for a short project, targeting at adding some features to it.  Or you can
  send money to the developers, because money does not stink.  Or you can
  contribute code and/or ideas.  Anyway this would start by contacting a
  developer and talking about it and check with their availability.

* I found a bug. What can I do about it?

  For bug reports, but also for technical and generic questions, don't be
  shy, get a github account and [file a bug
  report](https://github.com/Ghini/ghini.desktop/issues/new).

* I can read English but my colleagues want to have it in our own language!

  Fine, we can fix that, will you help?  Both software and documentation are
  [hosted on weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/ghini/).

  If your language is not listed, tell us: adding a translated is a routine
  activity, and the initially empty translation will be available less than
  10 minutes after we commit the change.

  Translations in the documentation will be (almost) immediately visible,
  while those in the software have to wait until a next release.

  Weblate is a courtesy of Michal Čihař, author of the very user friendly
  weblate translation support software.

* What other resources are available?
