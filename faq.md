* Why was the original Bauble project started?

  At [Belize Botanic Gardens](http://www.belizebotanic.org/) people felt that the other collection management software was either too expensive, inadequate or only supported Windows so they decided to create their own.

* But why for free?

  Wait: when we state that Ghini and Bauble are free software, we speak
  about freedom, not about price.  Bauble and the whole Ghini family are
  copyrighted and distributed under the GNU Public License.  You are free to
  use, study, alter, and to pass it to a colleague or a friend, but you will
  grant others the same rights granted to you.

  Said this, the authors acknowledge that commercial collection management
  software is economically out of reach for most institutions, save the
  largest ones in a few countries.  Bauble/Ghini contribute to providing
  unrestricted access to management of information related to biodiversity.

* What's this GNU Public License?

  Ghini and Bauble are not just free as free beer, they are free as free
  speech.  The GPL license introduced the concept of
  [Copylefted](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.html) and guarantees
  that the freedoms you are given with the product will stick to the product
  _for ever_.  The GPL answers the question "what if someone makes it
  proprietary": only the owners of the copyright can do that, and Ghini has
  already no less than 10 authors.

* How can I contribute to development?

  This is a question we love hearing!  You can hire a Bauble/Ghini developer
  for a short project, targeting at adding some features to it.  Or you can
  send money to the developers, because money does not stink.  Or you can
  contribute code and/or ideas.  Anyway this would start by contacting a
  developer and talking about it and check with their availability.

* I found a bug. What can I do about it?

  For bug reports, but also for technical and generic questions, don't be
  shy, get a github account and [file a bug
  report](https://github.com/Ghini/ghini.desktop/issues/new).
