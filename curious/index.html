  <h2>So you want to know more?</h2>

  <p>Bauble is a new web app for managing plant collections.  It is intended to
  be used by botanic gardens, arboretums and herbariums to manage their plant
  records and living collections.</p>

  <p>Our aim is to have first release in January 2014 and from there have regular
  incremental releases.  This means that Bauble will continue to get better
  each week with more features.</p>

  <h3>What does this mean for you?</h3>
  <p>It means that we are developing a new way to manage plant collections.
  Bauble will be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><div class="feature-title">Mobile friendly</div>
      Bauble will work on desktop computers, tablets
      and phones without extra fees and anywhere you have an internet
      connection.
    </li>
    <li><div class="feature-title">Cloud-enabled</div>
    This means that you won't need to host your own servers for your data.  Let us take
    care of the hosting, backups, upgrades and technical support.
      </li>
    <li><div class="feature-title">Open</div> The data you keep in Bauble is
      yours.  You can export it an anytime.  You can use our REST API to
      integrate with other software or services like statistics, mapping or labelling.
    </li>
    <li><div class="feature-title">International</div>
      Bauble will be translated to multiple languages and will support your locale preferences.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>It's too bad Bauble doesn't do what I've always wanted a plant record system to do :(</h3>
  <p>Don't be shy! If you wish Bauble has some fancy feature that you've always
  wanted in a plant record system then <a href="#/contact">let us know</a>.  It
  might be something we're already planning.  Or we might think its a great
  idea and put it in.  It doesn't hurt to ask.</p>
