Ghini is a suite of computer programs that help manage collections of
botanical specimens. It is intended for botanic gardens, herbaria, private
collectors, etc. to manage their collection information.

* **ghini.desktop** lets you create and query a database representing objects and events in your plant collection.
* **ghini.web** publishes highlights from your database on the web.
* **ghini.pocket** puts a snapshot of your database in your handheld device; it helps review your inventory.
* **ghini.tour** assists garden visitors with a map and spoken virtual panels.

In the good-old-bauble-days, we were only offering you the equivalent of
ghini.desktop.  The centrally placed ghini.web was born in August 2012, more
or less at the same time when I found out that bauble existed, and its
development has gone so slow mostly because nobody was missing it.
