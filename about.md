collectors, etc. to manage their collection information.

### some history?

In the good-old-bauble-days (**2005**-**2011**), Bauble was a purely desktop
program, with a couple of attempts to go web-based.

In **August 2012** the now centrally placed ghini.web was born and that's
how Ghini activity started.  Nevertheless, very soon after project
inception, Ghini found out that Bauble existed, and chose to adopt it,
rather than start from scratch.

**2014** was mostly dedicated to ghini.web, using the very same database as
the revived bauble.classic.

In **2015** we shifted focus on bauble.classic, now ghini.desktop.

In **2016** we made ghini.web a garden aggregator, with its own mongo
database, and chose to continue development under the unifying name Ghini.

In **2017** we added mobile apps to the Ghini family.

In **2018** we moved most active development to ghini-3.1, backporting to
ghini-1.0.  ghini-3.1 is python3 based, and sports some geographic awareness
right on the desktop.
