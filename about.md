Ghini is a suite of computer programs that help manage collections of
botanical specimens. It is intended for botanic gardens, herbaria, private
collectors, etc. to manage their collection information.

* **ghini.desktop** lets you create and query a database representing objects and events in your plant collection.
* **ghini.web** publishes highlights from your database on the web.
* **ghini.pocket** puts a snapshot of your database in your handheld device; it helps review your inventory.
* **ghini.tour** assists garden visitors with a map and spoken virtual panels.

### some history?

In the good-old-bauble-days (**2005**-**2011**), Bauble was a purely desktop
program, with a couple of attempts to go web-based.

In **August 2012** the now centrally placed ghini.web was born and that's
how Ghini activity started.  Nevertheless, very soon after project
inception, Ghini found out that Bauble existed, and chose to adopt it,
rather than start from scratch.

**2014** was mostly dedicated to ghini.web, using the very same database as
the revived bauble.classic.

In **2015** we shifted focus on bauble.classic, now ghini.desktop.  Plants
and Species can now have associated pictures.

In **2016** we made ghini.web a garden aggregator, with its own mongo
database, and chose to continue development under the unifying name Ghini.

In **2017** we added mobile apps to the Ghini family.  More import/export
facilities.

In **2018** most active development went into integrating the new mobile
apps with the desktop manager, and into porting ghini to python3 and gtk3,
add geographic awareness to it, and make it compatible with PostGIS.  As far
as possible, all new features get backported to ghini-1.0.
